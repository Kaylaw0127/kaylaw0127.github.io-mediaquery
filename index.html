        <p>
            I was born and raised in a small farm town, Sutter, right outside of Yuba City, CA. I now reside in
            Elk Grove, CA and have been living there for about a year. I have a daughter who will be two in March and am also getting married in June 2020.
            <br> 
            I am new to coding and am excited to learn the ins and outs of it all. I always love a challenge and this
            has proven to be that so far. When I put my mind to a project, there is nothing that will change it until
            I master what I am working on. Being organized is one of the main skills in which I believe will help me excell in this bootcamp and lead myself to a career in this field.
